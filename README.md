# Final Project - Store Module Test Automation

This is the final assignment for the class _Test Automation Warm-Up with Playwright_. We will implement tests to cover the core Store features on the playground page: 
- [x] Inventory
- [x] Catalog
- [x] Cart 
- [x] Payment
- [x] Orders

We've decided to go with a Data-Driven approach.


## 🕵🏻‍♀️ QA team

This team is composed with 2 team members: Andreia Rodrigues and Graça Silva.



## ⛓️ Base URL

The base URL for these tests is https://playground-drab-six.vercel.app/ 



## 💻 Project Setup

This project was setup by running ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies needed.



## 🗂️ Organization

- Structure: Adding helper functions to incorporate repetitive logic and thus improving legibility
- Each store tab is handled in a separate JS file.
- GitHub // Branches: Each tab has been addressed in a different branch and we merged it before going ahead on another one.



## 👩🏻‍💻 Test Run Instructions

- Run ```npx playwright``` test to execute all tests.

  or
- Run ```npx playwright test --ui``` to open the Playwright Test Runner UI.
