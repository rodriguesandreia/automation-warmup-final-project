# Final Project - Store Module Test Automation

This is the final assignment for the class _Test Automation Warm-Up with Playwright_. We will implement tests to cover the core Store features on the playground page: 
- [ x ] Inventory
- [ x ] Catalog
- [ x ] Cart 
- [ x ] Payment
- [ ] Orders

## Project Setup

This team is composed with 2 team members: Andreia Rodrigues and Graça Silva.
We've decided to go with a Data-Driven approach.

## Organization

- Structure: Adding utilitary functions to incorporate repetitive logic and thus improving legibility
- GitHub // Branches: Each tab has been addressed in a different branch and we merged it before going ahead on another one.
